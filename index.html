        I have a baby niece that I take care of.<br><br>

        I have taken Early Childhood Development in highschool.I believe children learn best in the ways that Erikson, Montessori, and Vygotsky taught and researched about. Montessori was an innovative educator who was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times because of her work. Her training in observation helped her develop innovative ideas for a teaching method for children. Some aspects of her method for which I consider a valuable truth to how young children learn is that teachers should provide real tools that work, they should make materials accessible to children so they can find what they need, and create beauty and order in the classroom. Montessoriâ€™s philosophy says that there are no comparisons to children of other grades because children learn at different paces and so classrooms include children of different ages. She also fosters independence, self-discipline, and responsibility. She believed children learned language and other significant life skills without conscious effort from the environments where they spend their time, meaning the beauty and order of the classroom is important. Teachers can easily encourage responsible behavior by allowing them to have the freedom to work with real tools, and are there specifically to guide rather than direct. Vygotsky doesnâ€™t stray too far from Montessoriâ€™s philosophy, seeing as he valued the information gained through observation of children. The cornerstone of Vygotskyâ€™s work was the Zone of Proximal Development, the idea that there are certain activities that children can not perform but that they will be able to if they receive help. The assistance is an example of scaffolding, which is the assistance given by a teacher or peer. Peers are just as important as teachers in Vygotskyâ€™s thinking, because he sees children's social experiences as important forms of learning, as well as social interactions where children have conversations where their competence is stretched. Erikson developed the 8 Stages of Psychosocial Development that follow as they go through life. I do believe that, when learning, children go through the stages he labeled as Autonomy Vs. Shame/Doubt for 18 months-3 years and Initiative Vs. Guilt for ages 3-5. Children do learn between being independent or feeling needy to develop will and learning between using their energy to grow competence/ confidence/ develop different skills or guilt. This stage will allow them to experience purpose, an important virtue to develop according to Erikson, which I believe involves child development. I do see my values reflected in my interactions with children, seeing as my values include integrity and humor. Being lighthearted is always fun in the preschool classroom because the children tend to befriend when they like someone who is there who participates and does things for them or with them. Interacting with children has been an insightful experience, because as I said before, I had very little experience with children. The most important thing I learned was about having fun with children in order to be present and positive with them and cultivate curiosity. Personally, I feel like I could take care of my own child in the toddler stage because having this experience at an actual preschool allowed me to see the functionality of a program that I have researched. Growing from an experience is important and easy when one reflects. Reflecting, I think that the area I grew most from my time at the preschool is how to reply to a child in an excited way when they bring something to your attention that makes them feel like they can be excited or share more with you.
